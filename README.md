# Recommendation Pipeline for E-commerce

A production-grade, event-driven platform for ingesting, processing, and serving recommendations at scale.

## Project Goals
1. **High-throughput ingestion** of click-stream and catalog updates via Apache Kafka.  
2. **Stream and batch feature computation** for real-time and offline models.  
3. **Modular model registry and serving** so any team can plug in a recommender.  
4. **Observability by design**â€”metrics, traces, and structured logs out of the box.

## Overview

This repository provides the infrastructure and tools to build a scalable recommendation pipeline. Key stages include message ingestion via Kafka, feature engineering, model training, real-time serving, and observability.

## Prerequisites

* Docker & Docker Compose (v2.0+)
* Python 3.8+
* pip (or pipenv/virtualenv)

## Getting Started

1. **Start Kafka broker**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
2. **Bootstrap Kafka topics**

   ```bash
   make create-topics
   ```
3. **Generate synthetic events**

   ```bash
   python3 event_generator.py --topic product-clicks --count 500 --rate 50
   ```
